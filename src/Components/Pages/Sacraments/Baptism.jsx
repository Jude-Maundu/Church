          <p className="fs-5">
            Baptism is the first sacrament that Catholics experience when they
            enter the Church. For many Catholics, baptism occurs shortly after
            birth. For those who convert later in life, it occurs during the
            process of conversion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Baptism involves a Priest performing a blessing over a person and
            anointing them with water. It removes original sin from a personâ€™s
            soul and any other prior sins. Essentially, it is a ritual of
            rebirth that leaves a permanent mark on the soul.
